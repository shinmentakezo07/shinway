Choosing the right LLM used to mean signing up for multiple accounts, managing different API keys, and switching between interfaces. Not anymore.

[**LLM Gateway Chat**](https://chat.llmgateway.io) lets you test any model in our catalog—GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, Llama, and 180+ others—from one interface. Compare outputs, test prompts, and find the best model for your use case before writing a single line of code.

## Built for Speed

The playground runs on:

- **Vercel AI SDK v5** — Real-time streaming with zero lag
- **AI Elements** — Clean, accessible UI designed for AI workflows
- **LLM Gateway's unified API** — Switch models with one click, no re-authentication

The result: a fast, responsive interface whether you're chatting with GPT-5 or generating images with Gemini.

## Key Features

### Image Generation

Select an image model (like `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`), describe what you want, and see results inline. Great for prototyping visual content before integrating image generation into your app.

### Smart Model Selection

Finding the right model is half the battle. Filter by:

- **Capabilities** — Vision, image generation, function calling, reasoning
- **Provider** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and 20+ others
- **Price** — Real-time pricing so you can optimize for budget

Search for "cheap vision model" or "best reasoning" and the selector surfaces relevant options instantly.

### File Attachments

Drag and drop images or documents into any conversation. Vision models analyze them instantly—useful for testing image understanding before integrating into your app.

### Everything You'd Expect

- **Streaming responses** — Watch the AI think in real-time
- **Reasoning display** — See extended thinking for models that support it
- **Saved history** — Every conversation is automatically stored
- **Multiple chats** — Keep experiments organized by project
- **Quick actions** — Copy, regenerate, or branch conversations with one click

## Coming Soon

- **Web Search** — Let AI access real-time information
- **Custom Tools** — Extend AI capabilities with your own integrations

## More Than a Chat Interface

The playground is a development tool. Use it to:

- **Test prompts** — Try the same prompt across GPT-5, Claude, and Gemini to see which handles it best
- **Compare costs** — See real-time pricing for each response
- **Prototype features** — Validate ideas before writing integration code
- **Debug issues** — Streaming visibility helps you catch problems early

Every request in the playground appears in your analytics dashboard—same tracking as production traffic.
